# 210. Course Schedule II

> There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
>
> Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`
>
> Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
>
> There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
